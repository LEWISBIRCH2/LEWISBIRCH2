## Hi there 👋

My name's Lewis, and I'm striving to become a Software Dev!

I'm currently looking for full-time work as an Apprentice, Junior, or Trainee Software Developer.


🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB, AWS, and Kotlin 

💬 Ask me about frontend styling or React 

🔭 I’m currently working on a MERN stack (freelance) project which allows users to securely log in and create their own personal exhibitions with artwork from around the globe
